This directory holds all model files which are required by facerecognition app to work properly.

Each set of files from a model is in separate directory, where directory name is identified of the model.

You should at least have one directory named '1/' in here. If this directory is not present, or it is empty
(there are no models in it), try executing `make download_models` from root directory of the application.

If this doesn't help, file an issue at: https://github.com/matiasdelellis/facerecognition/issues
