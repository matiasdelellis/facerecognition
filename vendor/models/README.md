This directory holds all model files which are required by facerecognition app
to work properly.

Each set of files from a model is in separate directory, where directory name is
identified of the model.

You should at least have one directory named '1/' in here. If this directory is
not present, or it is empty (there are no models in it), try executing
`./occ face:setup` from root directory of your nextcloud instance.

If this doesn't help, file an issue at: https://github.com/matiasdelellis/facerecognition/issues
